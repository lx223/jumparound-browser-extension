# JumpAround - Tab Switcher

A lightweight tab switcher for Chrome with keyboard shortcuts and fuzzy search. Quickly navigate between your open tabs using `Cmd+K` (macOS) or `Ctrl+K` (Windows/Linux), just like command palettes in modern code editors.

## Why I Built It

If you're like me, you have dozens (or hundreds) of tabs open at any given time. The pain points are real:

- **Mouse dependency**: Having to reach for your mouse, scan through tiny favicons, and click through tabs kills your flow
- **Tab overflow**: When you have more than ~20 tabs open, Chrome's tab bar becomes unusable - tabs shrink to unreadable widths
- **No search**: Chrome's built-in `Ctrl+Tab` just cycles through tabs in order - there's no way to search or jump directly to what you need
- **Context switching**: Breaking your keyboard-focused workflow to hunt for a tab is frustrating when you're in the zone

I wanted the same quick-jump experience I have in VS Code (`Cmd+K`) but for browser tabs. Type a few characters, fuzzy search finds it, hit Enter, and you're there. No mouse, no hunting, no friction.
